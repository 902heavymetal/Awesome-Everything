**Network Pentesting Tools**
- ftp pentesting tools
  - [ftp-fuzz](https://nullsecurity.net/tools/fuzzer.html) The master of all master fuzzing scripts specifically targeted towards FTP server software.
  - [ftp-spider](https://packetstormsecurity.com/files/35120/ftp-spider.pl.html) FTP investigation tool - Scans ftp server for the following: reveal entire directory tree structures, detect anonymous access, detect directories with 
    write permissions, find user specified data within repository.
  - [ftpscout](https://github.com/RubenRocha/ftpscout) Scans ftps for anonymous access.
  - [ppscan](https://packetstormsecurity.com/files/82897/PPScan-Portscanner.3.html) Yet another port scanner with HTTP and FTP tunneling support.
  - [responder](https://github.com/lgandx/Responder) A LLMNR and NBT-NS poisoner, with built-in HTTP/SMB/MSSQL/FTP/LDAP rogue authentication server supporting NTLMv1/NTLMv2/LMv2 (multirelay version).
  - [dark-fantasy-hack-tool](https://github.com/ritvikb99/dark-fantasy-hack-tool) DDOS Tool: To take down small websites with HTTP FLOOD. Port scanner: To know the open ports of a site. FTP Password Cracker: To hack file system of 
    websites.Banner Grabber: To get the service or software running on a port. (After knowing the software running google for its vulnerabilities.)
  - [Cyber-Sploit](https://github.com/Cyber-Dioxide/Cyber-Sploit) A framework like a metasploit containg a variety of modules for pentesting or ethical hacking. This repo willl be updated and new modules will be added time to time.
  - [FTPDumper](https://github.com/MatrixTM/FTPDumper) FTPDumper is an easy-to-use yet advanced FTP server file stealer. It can be utilized in massive FTP brute-force attacks, supporting various formats such as combo, pipe input, CIDR, 
    files, and even a single IP address.
  - [strongarm](https://github.com/whiterabb17/strongarm) Simple tool to bruteforce (spray actually) different network protocols.
  - [FTPSSH_Killer](https://github.com/usethisname1419/FTPSSH_Killer) Introducing FSK â€“ your sophisticated brute-forcing tool tailored for SSH and FTP services. Unlike conventional brute-forcing, FSK emulates the "password spraying" 
    approach by attempting three passwords per user. Once it exhausts the user list, it resumes by cycling through the next set of three passwords. This reduces the chance of lockouts and lost connections.
  - [FTP-Bruteforcer](https://github.com/calc1f4r/FTP-Bruteforcer) This is a Python script that implements an asynchronous FTP (File Transfer Protocol) bruteforcer. It utilizes asynchronous programming techniques to efficiently perform 
    password guessing attacks on FTP servers.
  - [brutus](https://github.com/shehzade/brutus) Brutus is a fast and simple way to bruteforce authentication on network services such as SSH, FTP, IMAP, and more.

  - [Q-FTPBREAKER-GUI](https://github.com/secleGhost/Q-FTPBREAKER-GUI) Brute force for multithreaded FTP capable of analyzing thousands of ftp in a few seconds and finding their passwords. It breaks Ftp in a few seconds and performs a 
    bulk scan randomly or by defining a range.
  - [FTPBruteForce](https://github.com/rix4uni/FTPBruteForce) FTPBruteForce - A faster & simpler way to bruteforce FTP server.
  - [Q-VISION](https://github.com/secleGhost/Q-VISION) Port Scanner And break FTP.
